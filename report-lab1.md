UCSD CSE 15L Lab 1 Report: How to Remotely Access UCSD Servers
=================================================
## Why this Article?
This article was written as part of an assignment for UCSD's CSE 15L class. However, I also intend for this to be a simple guide for myself and others about how I can run the command line on a server.  

## Installing VS Code
As I already had VS Code installed long before the assignment even began, this will be a recount of how I probably would have done it if it wasn't installed. 
First, I would go to [Link]https://code.visualstudio.com/ (or just look up vscode on Google). I would see a big blue button in the center of the screen saying "Download for Windows," which I would click (Mac users, I would presume would see "Download for Mac"). The setup wizard should be installed when I do. 
I would work through the setup wizard. Under "Other," I would check all of the options like so:

This is because I actually like to use code to edit my files. It's somehow aestheically pleasing to use, compared to things like Notepad++. Checking all items allows me to access VS Code more easily for different file types. 
Then I would click Install, and I should be able to open the VS Code application, whether it be via Desktop shortcut or Start Menu shortcut. 
## Remotely Connecting
We will start by making sure SSH is actually installed on our computer. The instructions can be found at [Link](https://google.com); I will summarize the steps here. 
I usually use a standalone shell such as Git Bash or the Windows command prompt to remotely connect to a server. However, CSE 15L recommends that you open a Terminal within VS Code, which you can do by selecting View -> Terminal, or by pressing CTRL+``.
