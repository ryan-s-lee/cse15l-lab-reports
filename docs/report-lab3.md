UCSD CSE 15L Lab 6 Report: Github Access from ieng6 (Choice 2)
========================

# Public key on Github

I have multiple keys on my account, two for my laptop (as a test to see how multiple keys would work) and one for the ieng6 server.  
# Private key

The ieng6 server stores my private key in the .ssh folder like any normal user account.  
# Running commit and push from server

The ssh key allows me to commit and push to the server, but I had to change the push mode from HTML to SSH first. It seems like I will have to do this every time I make a repo, at least until I find a shortcut.  
# The commit

Proof that my push worked.
